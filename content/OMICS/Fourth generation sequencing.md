Building on previous techniques from [[Third generation sequencing]] the fourth generation uses Nano-pores and adapters to detect the passage of single Nucleotides. 
They can be assembled on re-usable chips that are easily transportable![](../Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020241019143100.png)

The change in ions for the DNA polymerization is characteristic for each nucleotide and can be measured by the difference in membrane potential.
Overall this is a small efficient system that also enables the detection of epi-genetic changes
Currently, this system still has a high error rate but can measure an increased sample size. As before, this can be improved by the combination with other techniques.
