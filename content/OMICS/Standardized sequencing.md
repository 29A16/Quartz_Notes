To increase the quality of sequences, there are some recommendations on how to conduct sequencing, depending on the project size: 
 Darvin Tree of life in UK for chromosomal level assembly
	- 25x Pac Bio reads
	- 100x Illumina reads in Hi-C setting = enables to identify sequences that are close in 3D space but not in the primary sequence. This helps to put sequences in the right order on a chromosomal level
- T2T Telomere to Telomere genomes for longer reads
	- same as above 
	- plus 25x Ultra-long nanopore reads
