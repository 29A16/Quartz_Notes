OMICS: "[[L5 Proteomics]]"

A recent development in MS measurements is the use of data independent acquisition (DIA) over the [[Mass spectronomy (MS)|previous]] data dependent acquisition (DDA). DIA-MS focuses on a range of m/z aka an isolation window instead of individual peaks (in DDA). This generates more complete but also more complex data sets for the [[Tandem MS|MS/MS]].

With this the identification of peptides is more accurate (less missing values compared to DDA) but also harder due to the underlying complexity. Advancements on a technological level and on a software level (e.g. AI models) make DIA more and more viable and allows for a smaller impact of the [[Dynamic range problem]].
