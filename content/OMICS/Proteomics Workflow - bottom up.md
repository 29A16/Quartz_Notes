1. Sample collection
2. Protein extraction from the sample â€” Different techniques are available
3. Digestion of the protein into polypeptide chains by e.g., Trypsin ([cutting after each R and K](PowerPoint-presentation.pdf#page=22&rect=112,10,791,395|PowerPoint-presentation, p.22))
4. HPLC is used to separate the peptides by size
5. [[Mass spectronomy (MS)| MS]] analysis
	1. Generation of the 1MS spectrum (un-fragmented)
	2. [[Tandem MS]] after fragmentation
6. Identification of the peptides and generation of the protein matrix
7. Functional bioinformatic analysis
