OMICS: "[[L3 Transcriptomics]]"
---
After [[How to design an experiment|designing]] the experiment for the [[Bulk transcriptomics|bulk transcriptomics]], the mRNA is isolated and captured with adapters. For the sequencin, the mRNA is first translated into cDNA, which is then fragmented to generate the library. The fragments then undergo either single-end or paired-end sequencing. 
Since the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is also collected alongside the mRNA, it has to be removed via polyA selection or ribolomal RNA depletion. 
It is important to know how the rRNA was removed in the library creation for later analysis.
