When considering the design of experiments, it is important to consider external factors, that are not controlled within the experiment. These are **confounding** factors and could be e.g. the temperature of the lab or the amount of sunlight (depending on the experiment these can have major effects).
One should therefore always choose the *'balanced'* approach when conducting the experiment under varying conditions (e.g. at different time points)![[content/Attachments/KIMN20_Transcriptomics_intro_-521013114 4.webp]]
