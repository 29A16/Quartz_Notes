OMICS: "[[L6 Proteomics - Data]]"
---
A false identification of peptides during [[Database matching]] mostly originate from mismatches between the measurement and the theoretical spectra. To get an accurate scoring, the model has to be **adapted** to the experimental conditions, like the type of MS used to record the spectra. **Parameters** influencing the accuracy of the measurement like [[Mass tolerance]],[[Missed cleavages]] or [[Problem of protein Modifications|protein modifications]] can be defined to stringent or to lose and the overall **MS/MS quality** can influence the correct assignment of peaks. The same goes for the **assignment of charged** fragments.
The amount of recorded peaks can also complicate the analysis, when **isotopic clusters overlap** or overpower the peak of the **mono-isotropic** peak. The analysis of novel peptides of variants also complicate the assignment, since they are not present in the database.
