The main achievement compared to [[Second generation sequencing]] is the increase in the DNA template length that can be sequenced. 

Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing is utilizing engineered DNA polymerase fixated in a zero-mode wave-guide (ZMW) chamber that binds the sample DNA. This chamber utilizes precisely targeted light energy to analyze the polymerization reaction of each florescent nucleotide. 
The high amount of chambers and a millisecond timescale for analysis of the nucleotide enables a highly efficient. 
The time needed for the addition can furthermore be used to identify epigenetic modifications like Adenine and Cytidine methylations. The high amount of repetitions of the ZWM chambers also circumvents the intrinsic error rate of the method.

With modern chips, SMRT sequencing is able to analyze 10-15kbp
