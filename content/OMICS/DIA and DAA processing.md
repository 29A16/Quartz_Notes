OMICS: "[[L6 Proteomics - Data]]"

The main difference between Data dependent acquisition (DDA) and Data independent acquisition (DIA) is the range selected from the MS spectrum to be used for MS/MS. The traditional (DDA) way is to use specific peaks that are then closer examined with MS/MS. DIA on the other hand uses wider m/z windows, which are then examined in MS/MS. This creates more complex spectra, that are harder to analyze but also more complete.![](content/Attachments/KIMN20_data_identification_quantification_2067540178.png)
## DIA processing
Since the generated data is more complex, the spectra need to be deconvoluted. As for the traditional approach, the identification of peptides can either be achieved with the comparison to [[Database matching|a database]] — **spectrum centric approach** or more commonly with previously created [[New approaches|spectral libraries]] — **peptide centric approach**. The libraries can be created with DDA. 
The driving force for DIA is the use of more advanced data processing algorithms and AI. DIA can produce better results with the same equipment.
