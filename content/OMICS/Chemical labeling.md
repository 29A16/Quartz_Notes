OMICS: "[[L5 Proteomics]]"
---
In Proteomics, chemical labeling can be used to enable the [[How to measure and identify proteins|MS analysis]] of multiple samples in one run (multiplexed analysis). A specific chemical tag, that fragments uniquely in the MS is added to the N-terminus of the sampled peptide. The signal of the tag after the MS run identifies the presence and quantity of the labeled peptide.

This allows for reliable quantification of multiple samples in one measurement, removing the otherwise expected fluctuations between the measurements. The amount of samples is still limited to the amount of available labels, and the popularity of this technique decreases with better resolutions of MS equipment.
