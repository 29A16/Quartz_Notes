OMICS: "[[L5 Proteomics]]"
Topic:

#startingpoint 
Proteomics is the study of a given set op proteins expressed at a given time under specific conditions, as well as their state of modification. The complexity at this level of OMICS is one of the highest. Although there are around 20,000 genes, more than 1,000,000 protein variants with more than 300 post-translational modifications exist. One specific modified form of a protein is called **Proteoform** (multiple proteoforms of the same protein can exist within the same cell at the same time).
Another challenge arises with the **differential expression levels** of proteins where variations of $10^{6}$ in one cell and $10^{12}$ within plasma protein can be observed.
