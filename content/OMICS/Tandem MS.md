The data generated by [[Mass spectronomy (MS)|MS]] consists of the mass to charge ratio ($\frac{m}{z}$) of an Ion and the frequency/count of ions found at that specific ratio. **Tandem MS** aka MS/MS aka 2MS allows a closer inspection of the peaks generated by MS. After the initial sample containing multiple peptides is analyzed, measured peaks — representing a single peptide — can be isolated, fragmented and measured again yielding an MS/MS spectra, that shows a unique pattern/*'fingerprint'* that allows the identification of the initial peptide. This pattern enables the calculation of the peptide mass.

As the distance of different peaks relates to the molar mass **and the charge** of the analyzed Ion, different carbon Isotopes are also detected and have to be considered in the analysis together with their charge. When comparing e.g., a $^{12}C$ single charged ion in the MS/MS spectra with a $^{13}C$ carrying two charges, the distance of the two peaks should be 1 U when considering their mass (due to the additional neutron of $^{13}C$) but the distance is halved since the charge is 2 ($\frac{m}{z}$).

The Identification of peaks is further complicated by the fragmentation itself, although most of the fragments are formed by breaking the peptide bond, different versions also exist and their formation is generally not predictable. The height of the peak is also proportional to the properties of the fragment in the MS/MS spectrum. 
A combination of these effects can lead to the loss of peaks, that are covered by other shifted fragment with bigger peaks leading to loss of data/false identification of peptides.
