OMICS: "[[L2 Denovo Assambly]]"
---
Some factors making the assembly of [[Denovo Assambly|a new genome]] difficult, are the **genome complexity**, its **ploidy** (the more chromosomes, the harder the sequencing), the amount of **repeats** (which is often proportional to the size of the genome), **transposons** (jumping elements - short exact copies in the DNA) and rDNA (ribosomal DNA is most complicated to analyze, since it has large regions of repeated sequences).
