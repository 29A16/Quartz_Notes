OMICS: "[[L5 Proteomics]]"
---
Some peak profiles of the [[Tandem MS|MS/MS]] obtained from the [[Proteomics Workflow - bottom up|MS runn]] are sometimes ambigous and can belong to multiple different peptide candidates. Therefore, algorithms are needed for the estimation of the correct peak height and subsequent identification of the peptide candidate. It remains a degree of uncertainty, that is addressed by:

continue [[L6 Proteomics - Data#Errors in assigning peptides]]

The resolution and accuracy of the equipment is also always relevant for the identification of the correct peaks.
