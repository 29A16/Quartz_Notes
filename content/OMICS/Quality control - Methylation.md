One of the most important steps in [[Analysis of Methylation - Workflow|analyzing methylation]] is the removal of poor quality samples and outliers. Here are two possible ways of achieving this:
1. Plot the median intensity of methylated and unmethylated probe and decide on cutoff with sample index![](content/Attachments/Immunotek_Louella_presentation.pptx%202.png)
2. Find outliers by plotting the $\beta$-values of different samples![](content/Attachments/Immunotek_Louella_presentation.pptx%203.png)
