The intensity of the peak can be used for [[How to measure and identify proteins|relative quantification]] when comparing samples measured in the same way to e.g. obtain information on differential expression of proteins under different conditions.
Since the MS is used in tandem with a Liquid Chromatography (LC), the amount of peptide entering the MS changes over time. Integrating the frequency of the peptide over time yields the absolute value of peptide in the sample.
This data can then be used, as mentioned above, for the mapping of pathways and genes or the identification of PTMs. Another possible use case for the generated data is the study of secreted proteins (secretome), cell surface proteins or the degree of phosphorylation (phosphoretome) for cell signaling.
