OMICS: "[[L5 Proteomics]]"

[[Proteomics|Poteomic]] data can be used to generate insight into **post-translational modifications (PTM)** present on the studied protein(s), the **localization** of proteins in the cell and **protein-protein interactions**. 
Proteomic analysis is not superseded by [[Transcriptomics]] since the level of mRNA doesn't always directly correlate to the amount of protein in the cell. 
The generated data can then be used to identify molecular patterns or biomarkers, that differ between healthy and disease samples. This information can be useful in identifying mechanism of a disease, for the development of a diagnostic method or in the [[Precision medicine]]
