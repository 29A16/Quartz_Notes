The difference in experimental conditions between batches can overshadow the real biological differences. Finding **confounding** effects, that influence either the biological effect (dependent variable) or the experimental set-up (independent variable) and eliminating them is key. There are different tools available to find these variables to eliminate them, like Principal Variance Component Analysis (PVCA) or Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA).
