MS is the standard procedure for the [[How to measure and identify proteins|analysis of Proteins]]. An MS consists of three main parts, an **Ion source**, where the analyte is broken down and charges are applied, an **Analyzer** that splits up and sorts the charged fragments according to their size, which is detected by the **Detector**. 
Since proteins are hard to analyze MS couldn't be used historically until some key discoveries were made. Both MALDI and **Elcotrospray ionization** (ESI) are techniques that enable the use of protein samples in MS, but only ESI remains relevant today.

ESI is able to apply a charge to the sensitive protein sample in the gas phase, using a high voltage electric field to form charged droplets containing the sample. Heated dry gas is used to split the droplets into smaller drops, until the peptide/protein fragment is in the as phase.
