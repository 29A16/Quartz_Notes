OMICS: "[[L5 Proteomics]]"
---
One [[Benefit of Proteomics]] is the ability to find relevant biomarkers in heterologous diseases, that can be used to generate **subclassifications** of said disease. These subclasses can vary in their susceptibility to treatment and proteomics therefore can be used to personalize the medication and increase its precision. An example for this can be found in the application of **PAM50** for the identification of Brest cancer subtypes. The figure below shows a comparison of the markers of patients comparing Transcriptomics and Proteomics approaches, revealing, that not they don't directly correlate ([[Benefit of Proteomics|see]]). 
Another way to make treatment more precise is the application on a patient level, where the patient who is benefits most and suffers the least under side effects is identified.
