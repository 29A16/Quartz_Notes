OMICS: "[[L2 Denovo Assambly]]"

FastQ screen is another [[Processing of alignment data|processing method]], that can give some information on the presence of contaminants. The difference to [[FastQC]] is that there is only one mapping with different organism performed on the sequence. Depending on the study (e.g. use of trans-gens) the resulting matches can confirm the presence of foreign DNA from contamination.![](../Attachments/denovoAssembly_KIMN020%209.png)
(Example from a mouse study with human trans-genes) This shows contamination with Ecoli in the lower graph, as well as the presence of multiple unknown sequences (we would expect a high amount of unknown sequences in a *denovo* sequencing).
