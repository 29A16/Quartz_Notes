OMICS: "[[L6 Proteomics - Data]]"

When [[Identify peptides with tandem MS|identifying]] proteins from cleaved peptides, the inaccuracy of the cutting protein e.g. Trypsin during sample preparation produce some variance in the peptide sequence length. 
This hinders the correct identification and is a factor that should be considered when comparing the sample with a database.
