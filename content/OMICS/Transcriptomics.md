OMICS: "[[L3 Transcriptomics]]"
---
#startingpoint 
Transcriptiomics aims to study the whole set of transcripts in a cell, tissue, or population. the primary RNA is processed into mature mRNA by intron splicing, giving rise to different isoforms of the same gene, resulting in different gene products.
When only observing the genome, this diversity is not reflected.![[content/Attachments/KIMN20_Transcriptomics_intro_-521013114 6.webp]]
Different transcriptomic methods are used for different purposes:
- [[Bulk transcriptomics]] is used to generate the tanscriptome of a tissue, meaning the average transcription of multiple cells
- Single cell transcriptomics
- Spacial transcriptomics can be used to identify the location of cells and their transcriptomic profile
- Meta transcriptomics is concerned with population sized data sets
