PE= Paired end, meaning that the sequence is red from both directions. (PE150 means 150 bp are red from both ends)

| Term                                    | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Library                                 | Known sequences used in seqencing as adapters                                                                                                                                                   |
| Paired end sequencing                   | Sequencing is possible in two directions 3' and 5' simultaneusly                                                                                                                                |
| Coverage                                | How much known sequence overlaps with the genome (e.g. only one read =1x coverage), the more sequences, the higher the accuracy.                                                                |
| Label DNA                               | Flouressence, Beads can be used as labels                                                                                                                                                       |
| Barcode                                 | DNA tag that is added to the Reads/Library. After sequencing this helps to ID the samples in multiple sample sequenceing. If sampling multiple genomes they can be taged with a unique barcode. |
| RNAseq and whole transcript sequenceing | RNA sequencing, what is expresed                                                                                                                                                                |

| Exome sequencing                        | Just the coding parts are sequenced (sequence is known before).                                                                                                                                 |
| Amplicon sequencing                     | In population studies where just one part is relevant but for all members of pop                                                                                                                |

| Allele phasing                          | With good and long reads we can figure out which sequence comes from which chromosome.                                                                                                          |
