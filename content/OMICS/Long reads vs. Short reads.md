Long reads (possible with e.g. Nanopore reader) are able to cover longer [[Sequencing|sequences]], enabling better coverage and detection of complex and highly repetitive regions, but are limited in their throughput and require long fragments.
Therefore, long read technology is used for sequencing of *de-novo*-genomes and exomes, structural variant analysis (e.g. inverted sequences) and allele phasing.
Short reads are used for sequencing of RNA, Amplicons, as well as targeted re-sequencing or whole genome re-sequencing.

The use of the appropriate sequencing technique highly depends on the desired application. It is therefore important to consider the sequencing technique when evaluating the quality of a data set.
