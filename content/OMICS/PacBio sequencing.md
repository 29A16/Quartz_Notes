PacBio sequencing is the latest development in [[DNA sequencing]] and delivers a very high accuracy in the produced sequence, where the sequence is build up stepwise. The big novelty of this technique is a reversible nucleotide lock, that is moved on the 3' strain after each addition of a nucleotide.
The sequence is detected with flourescently labeled nucleotides (like originally in [[Sanger sequencing]]), that pair with the base after the lock. After the correct pairing the lock is moved and the sequence is identified one base at a time.
