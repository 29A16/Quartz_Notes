OMICS: "[[L2 Denovo Assambly]]"
---
OLC is more used for the analysis of bigger genomes, using long read [[Denovo Assambly|sequences]]. The generated sequence reads are comapred against each other, requiering more complex processing than alignment via k-mers. The Consensus sequence or *“Contig”* is generated from the aligned reads, in cases of disagreement the majority rules.![[content/Attachments/denovoAssembly_KIMN020 6.webp]]
