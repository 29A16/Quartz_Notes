As mentioned [[Quantification of peptides|before]], the quantification of peptides is possible due to the use of HPLC, which yields the **extracted ion chromatogtam** for one ion peak. This can be integrated over time to return the amount of that ion entering the MS. This **relative quantification** can be converted into **absolute** quantities of the ion/peptide if a reference peptide of known concentration is analyzed in parallel.
## Label free quantification
As the name suggests, label free quantification tries to circumvent the necessity of chemical labels for the quantification of peptides. This requires more complex data analysis but simplifies the experimental setup. 
One critical step to enable reproducability of the quantification is the adjustment for variation in the LC. Another problem is the dynamic range of the peptide species â€” if present in low amounts, they might not be detected.
