This method of measuring proteins is relatively novel and is applied in cases where a high dynamic range (see [[Dynamic range problem]]) in protein amount can be found, like in plasma samples. It is based on the use of Antibodies (Ab) and there are two methods, either employing single or two binders per protein:

SomaScan uses one adapter per analyte, where target proteins are detected at low and high concentrations simultaneously. For this ssDNA adapters with modified nucleotides are able to identify the protein target specifically. After specific binding of the target is confirmed, the ssDNA is detected with standard DNA sequencing. ([more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fg4mlG0nGLw))

Olink on the other hand utilizes two Ab per analyte, that carry specific DNA tags that hybridize, when both Ab bind in close proximity to each other (providing high specificity). The hybridized DNA is then completed yielding a unique sequence for each target protein. The amount of DNA measured after qPCR is proportional to the amount of protein in the sample.
