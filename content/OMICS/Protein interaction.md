OMICS: "[[L5 Proteomics]]"
---
To gain insight into cellular processes, [[Proteomics|proteomic]] studies are of great value. Not only differential expression levels under different conditions, but also protein-protein interactions can be utilized.
One possible workflow is outlined below:![[PowerPoint-presentation 2 1.png]]
Where the protein of interest is isolated together with its interaction partner(s) and then analyzed via MS. The generated insights can be used with more context to generate networks of interactions and propose e.g. metabolic pathways.
