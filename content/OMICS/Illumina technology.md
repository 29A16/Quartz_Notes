Fixated adapters are used to catch the fragmented (~500bp) sample sequence specific and a mechanism of 'bridge amplification' is used to generate multiple copies of the sequence locally. This creates so-called colony clusters surrounding each of the different adapter regions. 
The sequences are then synthesized with florescent nucleotides (one at a time) and all colonies are imaged simultaneously. All sub-sequences are then aligned with the help of references to obtain the final sequence.
This [[Second generation sequencing|second generation]] sequencing technique can be used on RNA but has a reduced accuracy compared to [[Sanger sequencing]] that is influenced by a lack of synchronicity between colony clusters.![[content/Attachments/KBTN20 Molecular Biotechnology.png]]
