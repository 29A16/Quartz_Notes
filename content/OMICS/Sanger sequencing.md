The polymerization of dNTP in DNA depends on the presence of an OH group at the 3' C of the ribose. Sanger sequencing utilizes chain terminating ddNTP during the replication a sequence to generate an assembly of different chain lengths. ![[content/Attachments/KBTN20 Molecular Biotechnology 3.png]]
If a fluorescent label is attached to each of the four ddNTP and the chain fragments of different lengths are separated in a [[Gel Electrophoresis]] the whole sequence can be identified. ![[content/Attachments/KBTN20 Molecular Biotechnology 4.png]]
This process can be automated, and today capillaries are used instead of gel to separate the chains by size in a time efficient manner.
