The polymerization of dNTP in DNA depends on the presence of an OH group at the 3' C of the ribose. Sanger sequencing utilizes chain terminating ddNTP during the replication a sequence to generate an assembly of different chain lengths.![](../Attachments/KBTN20%20Molecular%20Biotechnology%203.png)
If a fluorescent label is attached to each of the four ddNTP and the chain fragments of different lengths are separated in a [[Gel Electrophoresis]] the whole sequence can be identified.![](../Attachments/KBTN20%20Molecular%20Biotechnology%204.png)
This process can be automated, and today capillaries are used instead of gel to separate the chains by size in a time efficient manner.
