title: Welcome to my notes
---

>[!warning]  This site is under construction!
# What is this? 
This is meant to be a place to share my lecture notes. They are structured from the *'bottom up'*, linking related topics directly with each other without an imposed hierarchy. This is supposed to reveal connections between topics and facilitate a deeper understanding of the topic. Having this network of ideas build up over time with the addition of new allows to find new and exciting connections. 

I create my local network with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), convert them with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) and hosted on GitHub-pages. The connections are made with '*Wikipedia style linking*', these links can either lead to [[Proteomics|another Note]] or to [external resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvL1339luv0). 

> *I strongly recommend creating your own local network, if you want more information on how to publish it, contact me*
## How to navigate
If you are looking for a specific topic, use the folder structure/search function on the left site of the page. On the right site, you can find an interactive overview of all note clusters and their connections. I only use one tag at the moment to identify notes that introduce a topic (use the graph view or click here #startingpoint).

## Disclaimer
>The unavoidable mistakes you will find on the notes are made in good faith, I am working on a comment function, so that you can point them out if you find them (for now just contact me).
> That's it, have fun exploring!
