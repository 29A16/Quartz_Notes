title: Welcome to my notes

>[!warning]  This site is under construction!

This site is meant to host my lecture notes and other documents. Some of the notes were written during lectures and have some spelling mistakes in them. Substantive mistakes are made in good faith.

The Notes are organized inside of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and utilize '*Wikipedia style linking*', the links can either lead to [[Overview|another Note]] or to [external resources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvL1339luv0). You can also use the menu on the left, or the back-links and graph on the right to navigate between the notes.

My Obsidian Notes were converted with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz) and are hosted on GitHub-pages.
