OMICS: "[[L2 Denovo Assambly]]"

Gene prediction is used to identify genes after [[Denovo Assambly|assembling]] the sequence for annotation. The gene prediction software builds on **hidden markov models** and can either require training data or function independently.
Since there is a difference in the complexity of the gene structure between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the prediction of eukaryotic genes is also more complex (especially intros make it hard to predict the correct structure).
The prediction can either follow comparisons to reference data or it can be *ab initio* (from the beginning).

The gene prediction can then be followed by **Functional annotation** based on homology search of sequences in databases.
