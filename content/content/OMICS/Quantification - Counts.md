OMICS: "[[L3 Transcriptomics]]"
---
To enable the analysis of differential gene expression, we need to quantify the amount of reads, in our sample and [[Mapping and Alignment|align]] them to our genomic/transcriptomic reference. Depending on the quantification results, the obtained information can give useful information on the gene expression or can be ambiguous (if the reads overlap with multiple genes).
Since the preparation of the [[Library and sequencing|library]] includes the amplification of the generated reads with an PCR, the amount of actual copies of a gene can be obscured. To combat this *'over counting'* Unique molecular Identifiers (UMI) can be used to identify the *'true'* reads during library preparation. More recent library preparation techniques also include PCR free methods.
