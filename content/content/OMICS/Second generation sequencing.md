Also called Next generation sequencing expands on [[Sanger sequencing]] and can be split into two categories:
1. Sequencing by hybridization 
2. Sequencing by synthesis
Where the sequencing by hybridization doesn't see widespread application and is only used as a diagnostic tool. In this approach homologous sequences are used to identify known motifs on the DNA template.
Whereas Sequencing by synthesis is the approach most prominently used today to identify sequences from a template DNA string. In contrast to Sanger sequencing this technique relies on the fixation of a known starting sequence on the identification of the sequence by step-wise addition of labeled nucleotides to the ssDNA template. 
This allows for the sequencing of relatively short reads of 300-500bp and has an intrinsically higher error rate and therefore relies on a high amount of parallel sequencing and reference to known sequences.
[[Short read limitation]] also applies.
Two examples of Second generation sequencing are:
1. [[Ion Torrent sequencing]]
2. [[Illumina technology]]
