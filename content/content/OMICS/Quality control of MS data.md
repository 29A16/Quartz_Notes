To ensure the quality of the MS data, some important parameters should be considered:
- Data distribution of different samples (see [[Normalization of MS data|normalization]])
- Total intensities of different samples
- Mossing values between different samples
- Dimentionality reduction with e.g. PCA
These can also be used to remove outliers (based on technical errors).
