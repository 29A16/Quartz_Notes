OMICS: "[[L5 Proteomics]]"

The dynamic range problem in the context of proteomics describes the difficulty to detect proteins of low concentration in a sample. This issue arises from high discrepancy between the most ubiquitous protein and more rare ones. 
Plasma has one of the highest dynamic ranges, where albumin and hemoglobin can often account for 99% of the found proteins![](../Attachments/PowerPoint-presentation%207.png)
To combat this, **Sample fractionation** was historically employed, to first isolate intact organelles for subsequent analysis. Since this requires a high time investment and today's LC/MS systems have higher resolution (better separation of peaks), mass accuracy (of m/z values), speed, and sensitivity (detect smaller amounts of peptides) sample fractionation is rarely used anymore.
[[Affinity based quantification]] methods allow for the isolation and analysis of small fractions of the proteasome and thus combat the dynamic range problem.

Another solution for this problem can be the **Enrichment** of proteins with specific motives or PTMs utilizing cinematographic methods like Immunoprecipitation (with specific Ab) or immobilized metal Ion chromatography (IMAC) - for phosphorylated proteins.
