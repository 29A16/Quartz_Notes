**Telomere to telomere** (T2T) genome sequencing aims to sequence the whole genome, including historically challenging parts, like the telomesres.

**Haploid sequencing** also considers related genomes when analyzing a specific gene to identify the origin of the genes (e.g. paternal/maternal).

**Pan-genomes** take variations within a population into account to preserve different gene variants, that could get lost in a consensus strain.

The techniques above benefit from [[Long reads vs. Short reads|long read]] and next generation sequencing.
