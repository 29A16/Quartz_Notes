OMICS: "[[L4 Epigenomics]]"
---
The direct methylation of cytosine (as mentioned [[Epigenomics|here]]) often takes place in so called CpG (Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine) islands. These islands can be found in promoter or enhancer regions of a gene, regulation its expression. Abnormal methylation profiles of these islands can be contributing factors in diseases like cancer.![](content/Attachments/Immunotek_Louella_presentation.pptx%201.png)
