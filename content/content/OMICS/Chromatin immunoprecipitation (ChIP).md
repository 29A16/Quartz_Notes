OMICS: "[[L4 Epigenomics]]"

The histone modifications of interest are captured with specific Ab by immunoprecipitation and the DNA is sequenced to find out which regions of the DNA are affected by the specific histone modification.![](content/Attachments/Immunotek_Louella_presentation.pptx%204.png)
The analyses of the data is initially the same as in the alignment of [[Genomics]] data. The results are the visualized and compared to a reference genome, that didn't undergo immune enrichment to correctly identify peaks and differentiate them from noise.![](content/Attachments/Immunotek_Louella_presentation.pptx%205.png)
## Peak shift
To statistically verify the binding of a protein/histone at the specific sequence, the peaks have to be shifted. The regions around the histone binding sites are enriched, when the *binding site sequence* is fragmented and sequenced, two population of fragments are created. The antisense strand fragments '*on the right*' of the histone and the sense strand fragments '*on the left*' of the histone. Since this doesn't represent the binding site itself (but it's surrounding), both peaks have to be combined.![](content/Attachments/Immunotek_Louella_presentation.pptx%206.png)
