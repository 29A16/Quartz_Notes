The Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay's final output are the parts of the DNA sequence, that are governed by specific [[Histone modifications|histone modifications]].
ATAC-seq is another tool, that correlates the acessability/openess of the chromatin to gene expression. This is done by introducing cuts in the open sites of the sequence and amplifying these regions. The analysis of the data is the same as for ChIP sequencing, where the final output are peaks of enriched sequences![](content/Attachments/Immunotek_Louella_presentation.pptx%208.png)
