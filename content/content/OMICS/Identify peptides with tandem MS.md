#startingpoint 
The idea behind identifying peptides with an [[Tandem MS|MS/MS]] is to identify the ion peaks generated by the fractured peptides via comparison to a database. The reference for the peptide fragments can either be generated from measurements of standards or like outlined below theoretical peaks can be generated from the AA/DNA sequence.![](content/Attachments/KIMN20_data_identification_quantification_2067540178%203.png)
