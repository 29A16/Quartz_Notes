OMICS: "[[L6 Proteomics - Data]]"

Instead of using a database [[Identify peptides with tandem MS|to match]] with the measured spectra, a possible approach is to extract the sequence from the spectrum itself. The direct identification was often used for *denovo* approaches. Today the genomic sequencing of organisms is so affordable that the genome is almost always used as a reference. 

## Difficulties
The difficulties of denovo sequencing are shared with general errors in assigning peptides, like problems with protein cleavage, but there are some unique challenges to be found. The same (leu and ile) or **similar** (glu and lys) **masses** of AA and their derivatives (oxidized met) complicate their distinction. The same is true if certain combinations of AA are concerned. The directionality (b- vs y-ion) of and ion can't always be known.
Some problems can be addressed **in silico** especially with AI.
