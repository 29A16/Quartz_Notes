OMICS: "[[L3 Transcriptomics]]"

When deciding on the [[Library and sequencing|sequencing]] method, both single- and paired end sequencing are viable options. As the name suggests, the paired end sequencing starts from both ends simultaneously (R1 beeing forward and R2 reverse) and leaves the **inner mate distance** â€” the distance between R1 and R2 un-sequenced.
Paired end sequencing improves the ability to find the relative position of the reads, is more effective and can be used for novel transcripts as well as for transcripts with repetitive regions.
Single end sequencing has some downsides, but is more cost-effective, especially for small sequence lengths.
