OMICS: "[[L3 Transcriptomics]]"
---
As mentioned [[Transcriptomics|before]], bulk transcriptomics is used when comparing the transcriptome of multiple cells. One popular use case for this variation is to compare the expression levels of cells between two conditions/treatments, to figure out how the cell responds.
A typical workflow might look similar to this:
